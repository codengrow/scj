Saturday Code Jam (scj)
===

Saturday Code Jam is a project aiming at sharing knowledge and learning in the following topics of interest:
* Software Design/Architecture
* Programing Languages (C/C++, Python)
* Linux Tools
* Tech Talks

We get together every saturday and present our knowledge to each other. We philosophize over and over again about simplicity, compassion (sharing, learning, growing), freedom, explicity and patience.
